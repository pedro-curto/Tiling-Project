# Tiling Project

Welcome! 

This is a project made in a group of two in the first semester of my second year in university, for a course named Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms.

The goal is to, given an n x n square and n strictly increasing numbers, which we'll call c<sub>i</sub>, with i ranging from 0 to n, calculate the number of configurations that allow the area formed below and to the left of the c<sub>i</sub>s to be filled; for such, we can consider any combination of 1x1, 2x2, ..., squares, as long as it fills the area.

The code was written in C++ in English, and due to it being a small project it isn't commented, but the code is explained and analysed in the report file, written in Portuguese.
